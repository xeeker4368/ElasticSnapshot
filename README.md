# ElasticSnapshot
Displays all of the snapshots for your elasticsearch repository

This file should prompt you for your elasticsearch snapshot repository name, then show you all of your snapshots organized by snapshot name.  This was created for SecurityOnion, but  can probably be adapted for other elasticsearch indexes.
